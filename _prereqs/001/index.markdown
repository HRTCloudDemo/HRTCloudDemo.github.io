## Simple

You can work directly from your workstation. Make sure you have the following tools available:

* An editor suitable for coding, e.g. Atom, Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text
* [`ibmcloud`](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli#install_use)
* [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) (should come with npm)

On a Mac we recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install these tools.
