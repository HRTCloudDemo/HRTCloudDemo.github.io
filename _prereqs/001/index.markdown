Before you can start, you will need to create an _IBM Cloud_ account and a promo code for it.

## Get the Promo-Code

* Open [ibm.onthehub.com](https://ibm.onthehub.com/) in a browser
* Put the "_IBM Cloud_ Promo Code - 6 Month Trial" into the shopping cart.
* Confirm the account by clicking the link in the eMail you received.
* Register for the _IBM Cloud_-Promo-Code with your personal *registration code* that you received. You don't need the option "Requebst Additional Eligibility".
* Go back to the shopping cart and then to the checkout.
* Check the terms and conditions and choose "Accept", if you agree.
* Complete the details form. For the course name, you can use `Hochschule Reutlingen Cloud Demo`.
* Note down the promo code (it has the format `AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEEEE`).

With the promo code, you can now create a new _IBM Cloud_ account and extend the trial period by 6 more months. The code can only be used once. It is only valid for five months after creation.

## Create IBM Cloud Account

* Create a new account on [cloud.ibm.com](https://cloud.ibm.com).
* Confirm the account by clicking the link in the eMail you received.
* Provide a name for the new organization that is being created for you, e.g. your eMail address.
* As a region, choose Germany.
