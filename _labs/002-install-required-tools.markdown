We prepared a Virtual Machine image that contains all the necessary tools.

* Install Vagrant
* Copy [this file](Vagrantfile) into a new directory on your workstation. All files created in this directory will be accessible in the VM under `/vagrant`.
* Open a command prompt and enter `vagrant up`
* Connect to the VM with `vagrant ssh`
* Start developing!

Alternatively, you can work directly from your workstation. Make sure you have the following tools available:

* An editor suitable for coding, e.g. Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, vim or Emacs
* `cf`
* `git`
* npm
* node
