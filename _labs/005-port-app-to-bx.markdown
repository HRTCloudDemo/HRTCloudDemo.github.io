## Get the code

Clone your repository to your local disk.

## Create a manifest

Create a new deployment `manifest.yml` file in the cloned directory with the content shown below.
Be sure to provide a name that is unique (globally!!!) and replace the `**********` below:
<br><br>
```
---
applications:
- name: ************
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
```
<br><br>
This is a fairly simple manifest that should work for you as well. If you need want to check for more options please see https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html.

## Deploy

Run `bx cf push` to push this to IBM Cloud.

Once your app is working successfully, proceed to the next step.

## Create a CI/CD pipeline

- Go to the _IBM Cloud_ main menu
and click on **DevOps**, then click on **Toolchains** <br><br>![main navigation](main_menu.png?raw=true)![tc](tc.png?raw=true)<br><br>
- On the next screen, select **Create Toolchain** <br> <br>![create_tc](create_toolchain.png?raw?true)<br><br>
- Select the **Simple Cloudfoundry Toolchain**
and provide a name in the right (_IBM Cloud_-)organization<br> <br>![simepl_cf](simple_cf_tc.png?raw=true))<br>![tc_name](tc_name.png?raw=true).<br><br>
- You now need to connect your git repository to that toolchain, so that once you push your code on the command line of your local workstation.<br><br>
- You may need to authorize _IBM Cloud_ to access your **GitHub** account.<br><br>![git_auth](git_auth.png)<br><br>
- The toolchain takes over to process the deployment to _IBM Cloud_.<br><br>![tc_git](tc_git.png)<br><br>
- Once you created the toolchain, the individual tools should show **Configured** and the build and deploy steps are triggered automatically.<br><br>![tc_config](toolchain_config.png)<br>![tc_pipeline](tc_pipeline.png)<br><br>
- _IBM Cloud_ generates a hostname based on the git repository name, in this case `chat.mybluemix.net`. There is a reasonable chance that this name is already taken, so we need to work around this.<br>Create a `manifest.yml` with the following content:<br>
  ```
  ---
  applications:
  - name: WhoChats
    memory: 128M
    host: whochats
  ```
on your local machine. Then manually run `cf push` and verify your app is picking up the right name. _IBM Cloud_ is adding your host to the `mybluemix.net` domain  by default so your FQDN is `<host>.mybluemix.net`. Once you can access your hostname, commit and push your changes to git and wait for the pipeline to finish.<br><br>

## Test
- Try to access the url you provided by the `manifest.yml`
