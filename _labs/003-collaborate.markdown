In this lab you will create a team of two developers (e.g. with your neighbor) and collaborate on improving the application.

# Split the work

One member of the team will change the content of the application (`index.html`). The other member will change the visual presentation.

1. Create and embed a minimal CSS file into `index.html`
1. Create a Github Repository

# Devops Toolchain
