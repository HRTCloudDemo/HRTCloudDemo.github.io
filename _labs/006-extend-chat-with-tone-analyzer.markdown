title: Extend the Chat app with Mood Indication - Simple Microservice
---

# {{ page.title }}

## Purpose

Content of this exercise is to enhance the chat app 
to indicate the mood of a chat partner.

The Tone Analyzer App that you deployed in the 
"Consuming Services" exercise will take the role of a
micro service providing an API to get the mood indication.

This API is provided via the route "https://<your tone app>/tone"
which can be accessed via a POST request 
(Content-Type: application/JSON)

The request format does look like this:

```
{
  "texts": ["I do not like what I see", "I like very much what you have said."]
}
```

Depending on your implementation you can pass the content of one or more
(English language) chat lines in the "texts" property.

The service will return a response JSON that does look like this:

```
{
    "mood": "unhappy"
}
```

The service will return either "happy" or "unhappy" in the mood property.

You should use this value to indicate the mood in your chat application.
